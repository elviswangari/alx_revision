#recap of web servers

this repo contains:

[0-transfer_file](./0-transfer_file) => we configure a bash script to use `scp` to copy a file from local machine to remote web server

[1-install_nginx_web_server](.1-install_nginx_web_server) => we write a bash
script to install nginx, make sure listening port is 80 and when requested by curl return "Hello World!"
